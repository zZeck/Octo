run in winuae high compatibility on common amiga 500 config. Others may not work.
f12, host-> misc. save state, selet ram dump file option
do a search for the run length encoded file, the decompressed program will be a ways above it. seems to vary

TankBattle6.c8: looks very similar to tank ROM from collection. game seems to be the same when played. does not run in octo.
UfoIntercept2.c8: matches Ufo from collection
15Puzzle2.c8: does not match other 15 puzzle programs. Cannot slide piece in octo. Crashes emma02
ExampleA2.c8: new
ExampleB2.c8: new. Looks different in octo. Font difference?
Kaleidescope6.c8: very similar to kaleidescope. Similar situation as tank. both also have 6 appended in name. does not run in octo
WipeOff2.c8: same as joe weisbecker, but perhaps overdumped.

From the doc included:
"Note that some end in 2.c8  and others end
in  6.c8  .The ones ending in 2.c8 MUST be executed (pressing G) at
address 0200. Conversely the ones ending in 6.c8 must be executed at 0600"

example2b.c8 looks different in octo and dream mon. Incorrect font data? Did Dream have different font data?
15puzzle2.c8 font also looks different.
