Match The Hidden Number:
the menu text graphics in hidden number seem to have bugs //fixed after looking again
logic seems to be fine for displaying indicators and detecting win
pressing a number outside the valid input range simultaneously with a number inside the range will garble the display //interpreter bug? seens to happen if valid key is pressed slighly before invalid
//happens on Emma 02 COSMAC VIP emulation as well
//press legit key and hold, press out of range key and hold, release legit key. Will go off edge.

VIP Miniature Golf:
Displays nothing until 1, 2, 3, or 4 is pressed.
O and L may have graphical error. Check listing again //fixed


//TODO transcribe original text description.
//Verify behavior matches description.
