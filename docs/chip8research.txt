HPCVBBS
Hewlett Packard Corvallis Bulletin Board System, a dial-up system allowing users to discuss HP calculators and download HP48 software.
This was later available by telnet over the Internet, and has since shut down in favor of a web site only (and the BBS is now only Lynx pointed to the HP calculator website).

The cassette that was bundled with the Telmac 1800 contains more than
a dozen CHIP-8 programs.  If someone could convince me that these
programs are indeed freely redistributable, the other programs could
also be posted.  Otherwise, perhaps this one shouldn't have been.

Andreas Gustafsson (author of CHIP-48)
Hmmm - since I found these 3 Chip8-games on a PD-Disk from the Fish-Series
I supposed (and suppose) them to be not prohibited from copying.

But here are the important parts of the Amiga-Chip8-Document from
the Fish-Disk:
>  Michael J Bauer for the DREAM 6800 computer (May, June, July, & August
> 1979 issues of Electronics Australia).
>  Hugh Anderson & Graeme Teesdale for the ETI-660 computer (Mainly the
> November 1981 issue of Electronics Today International)
>  Whoever designed the RCA COSMAC VIP computer.

"The 660 was covered in May 81, June 81, Oct 81 and Nov 81

The Oct 81 edition has schematics for the PCB. "

https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=987&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a#p6471 mentions scans to dream 6800 being on chip8.com. might be worth looking through wayback machine

https://www.microbee-mspp.org.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=532 eti-660 references
"The initial articles were published in Electronics Today International (ETI) May 1981 and followed by 3 further parts in June, October & November 1981.
ETI then produced a '660 Software column almost monthly for next 2+ years with mostly game listings. It then converted to just a Chip-8 Column.
These Chip-8 listings can work not only on the ETI-660 but also the Dream 6800 and the Microbee with Chip8 ROM installed."

do a search for the run length encoded file, the decompressed program will be a ways above it. seems to vary. I think this is because some start at 0x600 actually.

TankBattle6.c8: looks very similar to tank ROM from collection. game seems to be the same when played. does not run in octo.
UfoIntercept2.c8: matches Ufo from collection
15Puzzle2.c8: does not match other 15 puzzle programs. Cannot slide piece in octo. Crashes emma02
ExampleA2.c8: new
ExampleB2.c8: new. Looks different in octo. Font difference?
Kaleidescope6.c8: very similar to kaleidescope. Similar situation as tank. both also have 6 appended in name. does not run in octo
WipeOff2.c8: same as joe weisbecker, but perhaps overdumped.

"This computer first saw the light of day as a series of articles that featured in
the May, June, July and August 1979 issues of the now-defunct magazine Electronics
Australia and it reappeared in a follow-up booklet entitled Microprocessors and
Personal Computers, published in 1980.
The DREAM 6800 (Domestic Recreational Educational and Adaptive
Microcomputer incorporating the Motorola 6800 microprocessor) was designed by
Michael J Bauer from Brisbane's Deakin University. It is not particularly
sophisticated but at the time offered those handy with a soldering iron the opportunity
to build a simple computer that would be a lot of fun to use. It offered programming
in two languages: native 6800 machine code and a strange but quite powerful
language called CHIP-8 (Comprehensive Hexadecimal Intetpretive Programming- 8
bit)"

"The Telmac 1800 was a set of electronics for computer enthusiasts (Telecras), which was released in 1977.
The basic model had 2 kilobytes of central memory, an interface to a cassette station, and the ability to connect the device to a television.
The keypads were mostly hexadecimal system numbers 0-F.
Telmac 1800 was manufactured in 2000 and sold in Sweden, in addition to Finland.
The first Finnish commercial computer game was released for the Telmac TMC-1800.
Raimo Suonio wrote a chess game called Chesmac on 1979, published by computer company Topdata Oy. The game sold 104 cartridges for 68 mark.
Jari Lehtinen launches Telmac in a demo session of the Technology Historical Society, and introduces the Chesmac game, which he has re-coded based on the files developed by Raimo Suonio, the developer of the game."

"One of the first computer clubs in Finland, 1800 User's Club, was also established mainly around Telmac users.
Telmac was programmed using machine language, CHIP-8 and M-2. Especially CHIP-8 became popular. A lot of nice games were made using CHIP-8, which is a very small interpreter (less than 512bytes),"

"The first part of this week (some three hours) was spent debugging the emulator, 
only to find out that actually the TANK game has a bug in it (the up/down keys are reversed and the target only moves sideways)! 
IIRC (it was more that 20 years ago) there was a bug in the original TANK game listings, 
so this file was probably typed in from those listing and never tested! 
Shows you how popular the CHIP-8 games are these days, doesn'it!"

for source comparison:
remove trailing whitespace //could effect text strings? unlikely
tabs to 4 spaces //could effect text strings? nothing likely to support actual tab character for indicating tab.
convert to unix line endings
ascii encoding
end with newline?
Or just hash available file?
what if source is embedded in another file?
document and do whatever seems sane
Really, readers will want to know the hash of the exact file I fed into the assembler
and the hash of the exact file I got out.
