Original devices did not have displays with pixel aspect ratios of 1:1
---------

Cosmac VIP, ETI-660, Dream 6800, and Chip48 interpreters all have different font data.  This can effect program behavior because of pixel based collision.  Some programs have text that looks off center as well.

Tested in Cosmac VIP and ETI-660 in Emma 02, Dream 6800 in MESS/MAME, and Chip48 in Emu48 for hp48sx.

Used cosmac VIP chip8 ram sha1 8AA634C239004FF041C9ADBF9144BD315AB5FC77

Used eti rom sha1 C0C4951E02F873F15560BDC3F35CDF3F99653922

Used chip48 2.25

which is sha1 16AB1BAC7D4861C26EFA4DF29E3AA3CE1BD8F7E5 after removing transfer dependent 13 byte hp header.

I suspect there are variants of the chip8 ram used by the cosmac and telmac 1800.
The author of chip48 had a telmac, but the font used by chip48 does not look exactly like that font seen in the chip8 ram used by Emma 02.
(same chip8 ram data is used for cosmac and telmac)
